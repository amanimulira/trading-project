# Trading Project: S&P 500 Market Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes historical S&P 500 stock data to uncover market trends, identify risk factors, and inform asset allocation strategies. The project demonstrates my ability to perform top-down market research, construct econometric models, and derive actionable insights for multi-asset investment strategies. By leveraging Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques, I evaluated ~500 stocks over 750 trading days (2014–2017), achieving an 83% project score through rigorous analysis and clear documentation.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gather and clean S&P 500 stock data, calculating daily returns for robust analysis.
- **Market Research and Analysis**: Apply econometric modeling to identify trends, opportunities, and risks in equity markets.
- **Risk Analysis**: Use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover key drivers of stock variance, supporting portfolio risk assessment.
- **Strategy Development**: Develop a simple trading strategy based on data-driven insights to inform asset allocation.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Processed and normalized ~500 stock datasets using Pandas, handling missing values and calculating daily returns for reliable analysis.
- **Econometric Modeling**: Implemented PCA with scikit-learn to identify principal components, revealing key factors driving stock variance.
- **Visualization**: Created visualizations with Matplotlib, including explained variance ratio plots with elbow and 95% variance thresholds, to communicate insights effectively.
- **Risk Analysis**: Analyzed stock variance to support portfolio risk management, providing actionable insights for asset allocation.
- **Documentation**: Produced a comprehensive report detailing methodologies and findings, earning an 83% academic score for clarity and depth.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis and visualization
- **Data Source**: Historical S&P 500 stock data (2014–2017)

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Sourced historical S&P 500 stock data spanning 750 trading days, covering ~500 stocks.
2. **Preprocessing**: Used Pandas to clean and normalize data, calculating daily returns to prepare for analysis.
3. **Econometric Analysis**: Applied PCA with scikit-learn to reduce dimensionality and identify principal components driving stock variance.
4. **Visualization**: Generated plots with Matplotlib to visualize explained variance ratios, marking key thresholds for interpretability.
5. **Strategy Formulation**: Developed a simple trading strategy based on identified trends and risk factors, suitable for multi-asset portfolio applications.
6. **Reporting**: Documented methodologies, results, and insights in a detailed report, ensuring clarity for technical and non-technical audiences.

## Key Achievements

- Successfully analyzed ~500 stocks to identify variance drivers, supporting portfolio risk analysis.
- Achieved an 83% project score through rigorous analysis and clear communication of findings.
- Demonstrated proficiency in econometric modeling and data manipulation, applicable to equities, fixed income, and other asset classes.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanimulira/trading-project.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
   ```
3. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook (`analysis.ipynb`) to explore the code and visualizations.
   - Execute cells sequentially to preprocess data, perform PCA, and generate plots.

## Future Improvements

- Expand analysis to include additional asset classes (e.g., fixed income, currencies, commodities) for a multi-asset perspective.
- Incorporate advanced machine learning models (e.g., time-series forecasting with Prophet) to enhance predictive capabilities.
- Integrate real-time market data APIs for dynamic analysis.
